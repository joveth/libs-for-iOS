<p>Gumbo is an implementation of the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/#auto-toc-12">HTML5 parsing algorithm</a> implemented
as a pure C99 library with no outside dependencies.  It's designed to serve
as a building block for other tools and libraries such as linters,
validators, templating languages, and refactoring and analysis tools.</p>

<p>Goals &amp; features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fully conformant with the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/">HTML5 spec</a>.</li>
<li>Robust and resilient to bad input.</li>
<li>Simple API that can be easily wrapped by other languages.</li>
<li>Support for source locations and pointers back to the original text.</li>
<li>Support for fragment parsing.</li>
<li>Relatively lightweight, with no outside dependencies.</li>
<li>Passes all <a href="https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-tests">html5lib tests</a>, including the template tag.</li>
<li>Tested on over 2.5 billion pages from Google's index.</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>Execution speed.  Gumbo gains some of this by virtue of being written in
C, but it is not an important consideration for the intended use-case, and
was not a major design factor.</li>
<li>Support for encodings other than UTF-8.  For the most part, client code
can convert the input stream to UTF-8 text using another library before
processing.</li>
<li>Mutability.  Gumbo is intentionally designed to turn an HTML document into a
parse tree, and free that parse tree all at once.  It's not designed to
persistently store nodes or subtrees outside of the parse tree, or to perform
arbitrary DOM mutations within your program.  If you need this functionality,
we recommend translating the Gumbo parse tree into a mutable DOM
representation more suited for the particular needs of your program before
operating on it.</li>
<li>C89 support.  Most major compilers support C99 by now; the major exception
(Microsoft Visual Studio) should be able to compile this in C++ mode with
relatively few changes.  (Bug reports welcome.)</li>
<li><del>Security.  Gumbo was initially designed for a product that worked with
trusted input files only.  We're working to harden this and make sure that it
behaves as expected even on malicious input, but for now, Gumbo should only be
run on trusted input or within a sandbox.</del> Gumbo underwent a number of
security fixes and passed Google's security review as of version 0.9.1.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wishlist (aka "We couldn't get these into the original release, but are
hoping to add them soon"):</p>

<ul>
<li>Full-featured error reporting.</li>
<li>Additional performance improvements.</li>
<li>DOM wrapper library/libraries (possibly within other language bindings)</li>
<li>Query libraries, to extract information from parse trees using CSS or XPATH.</li>
</ul>

<h1><a id="user-content-installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h1>

<p>To build and install the library, issue the standard UNIX incantation from
the root of the distribution:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install</pre></div>

<p>Gumbo comes with full pkg-config support, so you can use the pkg-config to
print the flags needed to link your program against it:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>$ pkg-config --cflags gumbo         <span class="pl-c"># print compiler flags</span>
$ pkg-config --libs gumbo           <span class="pl-c"># print linker flags</span>
$ pkg-config --cflags --libs gumbo  <span class="pl-c"># print both</span></pre></div>

<p>For example:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>$ gcc my_program.c <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">`</span>pkg-config --cflags --libs gumbo<span class="pl-pds">`</span></span></pre></div>

<p>See the pkg-config man page for more info.</p>

<p>There are a number of sample programs in the examples/ directory.  They're
built automatically by 'make', but can also be made individually with
<code>make &lt;programname&gt;</code> (eg. <code>make clean_text</code>).</p>

<p>To run the unit tests, you'll need to have <a href="https://code.google.com/p/googletest/">googletest</a> downloaded and
unzipped.  The googletest maintainers recommend against using
<code>make install</code>; instead, symlink the root googletest directory to 'gtest'
inside gumbo's root directory, and then <code>make check</code>:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>$ unzip gtest-1.6.0.zip
$ <span class="pl-c1">cd</span> gumbo-<span class="pl-k">*</span>
$ ln -s ../gtest-1.6.0 gtest
$ make check</pre></div>

<p>Gumbo's <code>make check</code> has code to automatically configure &amp; build gtest and
then link in the library.</p>

<p>Debian and Fedora users can install libgtest with:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>$ apt-get install libgtest-dev  <span class="pl-c"># Debian/Ubuntu</span>
$ yum install gtest-devel       <span class="pl-c"># CentOS/Fedora</span></pre></div>

<p>Note for Ubuntu users: libgtest-dev package only install source files.
You have to make libraries yourself using cmake:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install cmake
$ cd /usr/src/gtest
$ sudo cmake CMakeLists.txt
$ sudo make
$ sudo cp *.a /usr/lib
</code></pre>

<p>The configure script will detect the presence of the library and use that
instead.</p>

<p>Note that you need to have super user privileges to execute these commands.
On most distros, you can prefix the commands above with <code>sudo</code> to execute
them as the super user.</p>

<p>Debian installs usually don't have <code>sudo</code> installed (Ubuntu however does.)
Switch users first with <code>su -</code>, then run <code>apt-get</code>.</p>

<h1><a id="user-content-basic-usage" class="anchor" href="#basic-usage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Basic Usage</h1>

<p>Within your program, you need to include "gumbo.h" and then issue a call to
<code>gumbo_parse</code>:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-c"><pre>#<span class="pl-k">include</span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>gumbo.h<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>

<span class="pl-k">int</span> <span class="pl-en">main</span>() {
  GumboOutput* output = <span class="pl-c1">gumbo_parse</span>(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>&lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>);
  <span class="pl-c">// Do stuff with output-&gt;root</span>
  <span class="pl-c1">gumbo_destroy_output</span>(&amp;<span class="pl-c1">kGumboDefaultOptions</span>, output);
}</pre></div>

<p>See the API documentation and sample programs for more details.</p>

<h1><a id="user-content-a-note-on-apiabi-compatibility" class="anchor" href="#a-note-on-apiabi-compatibility" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>A note on API/ABI compatibility</h1>

<p>We'll make a best effort to preserve API compatibility between releases.
The initial release is a 0.9 (beta) release to solicit comments from early
adopters, but if no major problems are found with the API, a 1.0 release
will follow shortly, and the API of that should be considered stable.  If
changes are necessary, we follow <a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>.</p>

<p>We make no such guarantees about the ABI, and it's very likely that
subsequent versions may require a recompile of client code.  For this
reason, we recommend NOT using Gumbo data structures throughout a program,
and instead limiting them to a translation layer that picks out whatever
data is needed from the parse tree and then converts that to persistent
data structures more appropriate for the application.  The API is
structured to encourage this use, with a single delete function for the
whole parse tree, and is not designed with mutation in mind.</p>

<h1><a id="user-content-python-usage" class="anchor" href="#python-usage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Python usage</h1>

<p>To install the python bindings, make sure that the
C library is installed first, and then <code>sudo python setup.py install</code> from
the root of the distro.  This installs a 'gumbo' module; <code>pydoc gumbo</code>
should tell you about it.</p>

<p>Recommended best-practice for Python usage is to use one of the adapters to
an existing API (personally, I prefer BeautifulSoup) and write your program
in terms of those.  The raw CTypes bindings should be considered building
blocks for higher-level libraries and rarely referenced directly.</p>
