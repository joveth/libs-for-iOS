# TAPromotee

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/TAPromotee.svg?style=flat)](http://cocoapods.org/pods/AbTrackingLib)


TAPromotee is a pod that allows you to show a cross promotion to a iOS app just by supplying its App Store id. It automatically fetches the info about the app using the iTunes API:

- App name
- App icon
- App price
- Screenshot 

When the user taps the install button, the `SKStoreProductViewController` is presented.


## Requirements

- iOS 7.0+
- iPhone
- Portrait orientation

## Install

TAPromotee is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), to install
it simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'TAPromotee'
```

## Usage

To run the example project run `pod try TAPromotee` or clone the repo.

Here's an example of how you should use TAPromotee. 

```objc
#import "TAPromotee.h"
```




```objc
[TAPromotee showFromViewController:self 
                             appId:822702909 
                           caption:@"Sun clock in your pocket" 
                        completion:^(TAPromoteeUserAction userAction) {
    switch (userAction) {
        case TAPromoteeUserActionDidClose:
            // The user just closed the add
            NSLog(@"User did click close");
            break;
        case TAPromoteeUserActionDidInstall:
            // The user did click on the Install button so here you can for example disable the ad for the future
            NSLog(@"User did click install");
            break;
    }
}];
    
```

If you don't want to use the App Store screenshot as background, you can supply a custom background image

```objective-c
[TAPromotee showFromViewController:self
                             appId:937151343
                           caption:@"Your Battlefield soldier's companion"
                   backgroundImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"sample-app-background"]
                        completion:^(TAPromoteeUserAction userAction) {
    switch (userAction) {
        case TAPromoteeUserActionDidClose:
            // The user just closed the add
            NSLog(@"User did click close");
            break;
        case TAPromoteeUserActionDidInstall:
            // The user did click on the Install button so here you can for example disable the ad for the future
            NSLog(@"User did click install");
            break;
    }
}];
```
