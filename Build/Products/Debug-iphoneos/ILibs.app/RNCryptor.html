<p>Cross-language AES Encryptor/Decryptor data
format.For more information,please visit RNCryptor/RNCryptor on GitHub.</p>

<p>The primary target is Objective-C, but implementations are available in
<a href="https://github.com/RNCryptor/RNCryptor-cpp">C++</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/RNCryptor/RNCryptor-cs">C#</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/RNCryptor/JNCryptor">Java</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/RNCryptor/RNCryptor-php">PHP</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/RNCryptor/RNCryptor-python">Python</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/RNCryptor/rncryptor-js">Javascript</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/RNCryptor/ruby_rncryptor">Ruby</a>.</p>

<p>The data format includes all the metadata required to securely implement AES
encryption, as described in <a href="http://robnapier.net/aes-commoncrypto">"Properly encrypting with AES with
CommonCrypto,"</a> and <a href="http://iosptl.com"><em>iOS 6
Programming Pushing the Limits</em></a>, Chapter 15. Specifically,
it includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>AES-256 encryption</li>
<li>CBC mode</li>
<li>Password stretching with PBKDF2</li>
<li>Password salting</li>
<li>Random IV</li>
<li>Encrypt-then-hash HMAC</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="user-content-basic-objective-c-usage" class="anchor" href="#basic-objective-c-usage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Basic Objective-C Usage</h2>

<p>The most common in-memory use case is as follows:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-objc"><pre><span class="pl-c1">NSData</span> *data = [<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">@"</span>Data<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> <span class="pl-c1">dataUsingEncoding:</span>NSUTF8StringEncoding];
<span class="pl-c1">NSError</span> *error;
<span class="pl-c1">NSData</span> *encryptedData = [RNEncryptor <span class="pl-c1">encryptData:</span>data
                                    <span class="pl-c1">withSettings:</span><span class="pl-c1">kRNCryptorAES256Settings</span>
                                          <span class="pl-c1">password:</span>aPassword
                                             <span class="pl-c1">error:</span>&amp;error];</pre></div>

<p>This generates an <code>NSData</code> including a header, encryption salt, HMAC salt, IV,
ciphertext, and HMAC. To decrypt this bundle:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-objc"><pre><span class="pl-c1">NSData</span> *decryptedData = [RNDecryptor <span class="pl-c1">decryptData:</span>encryptedData
                                    <span class="pl-c1">withPassword:</span>aPassword
                                           <span class="pl-c1">error:</span>&amp;error];</pre></div>

<p>Note that <code>RNDecryptor</code> does not require settings. These are read from the
header.</p>

<h2><a id="user-content-asynchronous-use" class="anchor" href="#asynchronous-use" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Asynchronous use</h2>

<p><code>RNCryptor suports asynchronous use, specifically designed to work with
</code>NSURLConnection. This is also useful for cases where the encrypted or decrypted
<code>data will not comfortably fit in memory. If the data will comfortably fit in
</code>memory, asynchronous operation is best acheived using dispatch_async().</p>

<p>To operate in asynchronous mode, you create an <code>RNEncryptor</code> or <code>RNDecryptor</code>,
providing it a handler. This handler will be called as data is encrypted or
decrypted. As data becomes available, call <code>addData:</code>. When you reach the end of
the data call <code>finish</code>.</p>

<h2><a id="user-content-async-and-streams" class="anchor" href="#async-and-streams" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Async and Streams</h2>

<p>When performing async operations on streams, the data can come very quickly
(particularly if you're reading from a local file). If you use RNCryptor in a
na√Øve way, you'll queue a work blocks faster than the engine can process them
and your memory usage will spike. This is particularly true if there's only one
core, such as on an iPad 1. The solution is to only dispatch new work blocks as
the previous work blocks complete.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-objc"><pre><span class="pl-c">// Make sure that this number is larger than the header + 1 block.</span>

<p>I'll eventually get this into the API to simplify things. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/14586231/97337">Cyrille's SO
question</a> for more discussion. Pull
requests welcome.</p>

<h2><a id="user-content-building" class="anchor" href="#building" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building</h2>

<p>Comes packaged as a static library, but the source files can be dropped into any
project. The OpenSSL files are not required.</p>

<p>Requires <code>Security.framework</code>.</p>

<p>Supports 10.6+ and iOS 4+.</p>

<p>The current file format is v3. To read v1 files (see Issue #44), you need to set the compile-time macro <code>RNCRYPTOR_ALLOW_V1_BAD_HMAC</code>. It is not possible to write v1 files anymore.</p>

<h2><a id="user-content-design-considerations" class="anchor" href="#design-considerations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Design considerations</h2>

<p><code>RNCryptor</code> has several design goals, in order of importance:</p>

<h3><a id="user-content-easy-to-use-correctly-for-most-common-use-cases" class="anchor" href="#easy-to-use-correctly-for-most-common-use-cases" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Easy to use correctly for most common use cases</h3>

<p>The most critical concern is that it be easy for non-experts to use <code>RNCryptor</code> correctly. A framework that is more secure, but requires a steep learning curve on the developer will either be not used, or used incorrectly. Whenever possible, a single line of code should "do the right thing" for the most common cases.</p>

<p>This also requires that it fail correctly and provide good errors.</p>

<h3><a id="user-content-reliance-on-commoncryptor-functionality" class="anchor" href="#reliance-on-commoncryptor-functionality" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reliance on CommonCryptor functionality</h3>

<p><code>RNCryptor</code> has very little "security" code. It relies as much as possible on the OS-provided CommonCryptor. If a feature does not exist in CommonCryptor, then it generally will not be provided in <code>RNCryptor</code>.</p>

<h3><a id="user-content-best-practice-security" class="anchor" href="#best-practice-security" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Best practice security</h3>

<p>Wherever possible within the above constraints, the best available algorithms
are applied. This means AES-256, HMAC+SHA1, and PBKDF2:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>AES-256. While Bruce Schneier has made some interesting recommendations
regarding moving to AES-128 due to certain attacks on AES-256, my current
thinking is in line with <a href="http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2009-07-31-thoughts-on-AES.html">Colin
Percival</a>.
PBKDF2 output is effectively random, which should negate related-keys attacks
against the kinds of use cases we're interested in.</p></li>
<li><p>AES-CBC mode. This was a somewhat complex decision, but the ubiquity of CBC
outweighs other considerations here. There are no major problems with CBC mode,
and nonce-based modes like CTR have other trade-offs. See <a href="http://robnapier.net/blog/mode-rncryptor">"Mode changes for
RNCryptor"</a> for more details on this
decision.</p></li>
<li><p>Encrypt-then-MAC. If there were a good authenticated AES mode on iOS (GCM for
instance), I would probably use that for its simplicity. Colin Percival makes
<a href="http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2009-06-24-encrypt-then-mac.html">good arguments for hand-coding an encrypt-than-
MAC</a> rather
than using an authenticated AES mode, but in RNCryptor mananging the HMAC
actually adds quite a bit of complexity. I'd rather the complexity at a more
broadly peer-reviewed layer like CommonCryptor than at the RNCryptor layer. But
this isn't an option, so I fall back to my own Encrypt-than-MAC.</p></li>
<li><p>HMAC+SHA256. No surprises here.</p></li>
<li><p>PBKDF2. While bcrypt and scrypt may be more secure than PBKDF2, CommonCryptor
only supports PBKDF2. <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/4781/do-any-security-experts-recommend-bcrypt-for-password-storage">NIST also continues to recommend
PBKDF2</a>. We use 10k rounds of PBKDF2
which represents about 80ms on an iPhone 4.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="user-content-code-simplicity" class="anchor" href="#code-simplicity" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Code simplicity</h3>

<p><code>RNCryptor endeavors to be implemented as simply as possible, avoiding tricky
</code>code. It is designed to be easy to read and code review.</p>

<h3><a id="user-content-performance" class="anchor" href="#performance" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Performance</h3>

<p>Performance is a goal, but not the most important goal. The code must be secure
and easy to use. Within that, it is as fast and memory-efficient as possible.</p>

<h3><a id="user-content-portability" class="anchor" href="#portability" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Portability</h3>

<p>Without sacrificing other goals, it is preferable to read the output format of
<code>RNCryptor</code> on other platforms.</p>

<h2><a id="user-content-version-history" class="anchor" href="#version-history" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Version History</h2>

<ul>
<li>v2.2 Switches to file format v3 to deal with Issue #77.</li>
<li>v2.1 Switches to file format v2 to deal with Issue #44.</li>
<li>v2.0 adds asynchronous modes.</li>
<li>v2.1 backports <code>RNCryptor</code> to older versions of Mac OS X (and possibly iOS).</li>
</ul>
